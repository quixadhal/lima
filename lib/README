Welcome to the ALPHA release of the Lima Mudlib!

When you find our documentation inadequate, please come to our lib
support mud, Lima Bean, and ask questions (or type news and post
them there).

Lima Bean is located at:
lima.mudlib.org 7878
(208.192.43.32 7878)

Additional information and documentation is also available on our web pages:

Mudlib Features:
 o Centralized natural language parsing (zork like commands for players).
 o Socials use the natural language parsing, and are easy to extend.
	(The soul is *huge*).
 o Wizards have featureful shells including full unix globbing (ls *.[ch]),
	command piping / redirection, etc...
 o Inline documentation.	
 o Distributed support.
 o Very modular, with clear code.
 o Support for Intermud-3.
 o Modal input, and fully featured interactive shells.
 o Real, secure security authored by Ellery @ TMI-2 (Remier Behrends).
 o Emphasis on player usability:
	better news, channels, menus, etc...
	than any other mudlib
 o Easy to build menus, easy to write socials, etc...
 o A menu driven admin tool to ease routine administration tasks.
