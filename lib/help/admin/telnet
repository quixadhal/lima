Help for telnet:

Start up telnet by typing:
telnet

The prompt will change to #, meaning you're in telnet mode.
Any input not directly to the telnet program will go to your
average shell instead.

Text received from a telnet session will start with the tilde  ( '~' ).

Telnet understands the following commands:

/exit  -- quit telnet

/open [address|mudname]  -- opens a new telnet session.  
			    mudname can be any mud name or a unique part
			    of a mud name based on the muds you can see
			    by typing: "mudlist".
			    Right now if you use an address, it must be
			    an ip number, and not an ip name.
	 	            If you have more than one session open, 
			    you'll only be interacting with the current 
			    session.

/jobs  -- shows what sessions you have open.

/goto [job#] -- changes your active session to the given number 
		(if you have more than one session)

/tog   -- toggles whether or not your regular input should go to the active
	  session or to the mud you're on.  By default it goes to the mud
	  you're on.

/send <str>  -- send input to the active session.  You don't need to do this
		if you've done /tog once, you can just type the input and
		it goes.		

/close -- closes the currently active session.

/hide  -- You don't see any of the text from remote telnet connections if
	  you use this.  /hide again to bring the text back.

/help		-- This document.
/?

! as the first character always sends your input to your command shell
instead of a telnet session.  To send a string to a telnet session that
starts with a !, use '/send !string'.

*N.B.  Some people have a hard time using / with tinyfugue.  If you need to
       change the control character, set the telnet_char environment variable.
	EG:
		set telnet_char %


If there is demand, auto-logins, etc... will be added to this program.
