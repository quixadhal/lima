$$ see: snoopable
Though technically your legal rights on a mud are very limited,
the administration of ZorkMUD tries its best to treat you as
human beings, and respect your privacy.  The most destructive
invasion of privacy on muds is the ability for Wizards to snoop.
ZorkMUD's policy on snooping is hard coded:

1) There is a player command called "snoopable."  Turning it on
   allows a Wizard to snoop you.  Default is off.  If you want to
   show a Wizard a bug, or have them watch what you are doing for
   some reason, turn it on, but otherwise it's a good idea to leave
   it off to protect your privacy.

2) Administrators of the mud will always be able to snoop you.  They
   have been hand-picked so that they are EXTREMELY trustable
   individuals with excellent and final judgment.  They will only
   make use of this power when cheating or other illegal behavior is
   STRONGLY suspected.

3) All Wizards have the ability to override your "snoopable" flag.
   The only valid excuse for doing this is if they have an EXTREMELY
   good reason for doing this without your consent.  If they STRONGLY
   suspect illegal behavior, and there is no Administrator around to
   handle the problem, they may override.

4) ANY use of this override command will be carefully scrutinized by
   the administration of the mud.  The Wizard MUST provide a reason
   before the command will work, and they are required to turn in a
   report about the snoop afterwards.

5) Wizards using the override command without excuse, or whoose
   excuse is deemed inadequate by an Admin will be publicly
   reprimanded once, then dismissed if such an event happens again.

6) The Wizards are physically incapable of superseding these rules.
   However, there is no protection from a Wizard eavesdropping by
   being invisible in a room in which a conversation is occurring.
   Though Wizards are expected to show discretion, you may restrict
   your conversations to tells if you want to ensure privacy.
