USAGE: converse

Puts you into conversation mode, which means that anything you type
will act as if you are placing the "say" command before it.  Once in
conversation mode, you exit the same way you do from the mail or
bulletin board editor, that is, by typing a '.' alone on a line.  You
may also issue commands while in conversation mode by putting a !
before whatever you type.
