USAGE:	adverbs [pattern]

Without an argument, shows all adverbs that you can use in soul commands.
With an argument, shows all adverbs matching the given pattern.

Example:
    adverbs f*ly 

 will show you all adverbs that start w/ 'f' and end in 'ly'

To use an adverb in a soul command, use as much of the adverb as necessary 
to uniquely identify it, followed by a *.

For example:
    smile fla*

will translate to: 'smile flatly'.

But: 'smile fl*' will not, because 'flirtingly' also starts with fl.
