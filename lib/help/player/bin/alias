USAGE:
There are 3 different versions of the alias command:

alias  -- will give you a menu for adding aliases.  some things can only
	  be done through the alias menu.

alias str -- shows the value of alias 'str'

alias str expansion -- sets the alias 'str' to the expansion.



An alias definition can change each time you use the alias:
$1  -- Wherever you put this in your alias definition,
       the $1 will be replaced with the first word after
       the alias when you use the alias.
       You can do the same with $2, $3, $4, ad infinitum.
       If you have $1 in your alias definition, but don't
       provide a first argument when you use an alias,
       the default value for $1 is used.  

       If you're using the alias menu to add an alias, you can set the
       default value when you are done with the alias definition.

       Example:  If you alias "you're" to:
                  say Hey, $2, you're $1!
       When you type:
                  you're studly Rust
       You'll say: "Hey, Rust, you're studly!"

$*  -- It's the same as $1, but it means 'everything else'. 
       Example:  If you alias "you're" to:
                  say $2, you're $1!  Do you $*?       When you type:
                 you're studly Rust exercise much
	You'll say: "Hey, Rust, you're studly!  Do you exercise much?"

Notice $* matches any number of words, whereas $1, $2, etc...
only match one word.

If you don't put a $* in your expansion, one will be automatically
added to the end of the alias for you.


If you have an alias, but don't want to use it, you can prepend a \ to 
make the game ignore your alias.  For example, if you have 'grin' aliased 
to 'grin evilly', and you type:

    \grin psychopathically

you'll get:
    You grin psychopathically.


To make an alias where you don't need to type a space after the alias,
use the menu, and answer 'y' when the game asks: 'Allow space omission?'
