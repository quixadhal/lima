The chan command is the central command for all channel
communication.  Below are the various forms the command takes:

chan			- list channels being listened to
chan gossip		- find out whether the 'gossip' channel is
			  begin listened to
chan gossip /on		- turn listening on for the 'gossip' channel
chan gossip /off	- stop listening to 'gossip'
chan gossip /list	- find out who is listening to 'gossip'
chan gossip /who	- same as /list
chan gossip /last	- show the last 20 messages on the channel
chan gossip <msg>	- send <msg> to all listeners
chan gossip ;<feeling>	- perform <feeling> over the channel
			  (e.g. chan gossip ;grin)
chan gossip :<emote>	- send <emote> to all listeners
			  (e.g. chan gossip :wants a big sword!)
chan mine /new		- create the "mine" channel

Of course, the 'gossip' may be replaced with any channel name you
might want to use.

chan will create a channel, if necessary, when you first start
to listen to it.  There are (currently) no restrictions on the
number or channels you may listen to or create.  Once you listen
to a channel, you can simply use its name for operating the channel.

Two player channels are standard: gossip and newbie

Some examples:

> chan
You are listening to: gossip, newbie, mychannel
> chan gossip /off
You are no longer listening to 'gossip'.
> mychannel /list
Users listening to 'mychannel': Johndoe, Smurfhead, Tarzan
> mychannel hello!
[mychannel] Smurfhead: hello!
> mychannel :turns a bright shade of blue
[mychannel] Smurfhead turns a bright shade of blue.
> mychannel ;laugh tarzan
[mychannel] You laugh at Tarzan.
>
> [mychannel] Tarzan bops you on the nose.
