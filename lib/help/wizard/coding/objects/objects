The following example is a bare bones object.  It really doesnt
do anything nor can you do anything with it but look at it.

#include <mudlib.h>

inherit OBJ;

setup() 
{
    set_id(  "terminal", "computer"  );
    set_adj(  "dumb"  );
    set_long( "It looks like it has an IQ of about 30." );
}

This object will repond to the names "terminal" and "computer" 
also will repond to "dumb terminal" and "dumb computer".

This object is very boring, completely useless. Lets make it
more interesting.

set_proper_name("Excalibur");       

    This will force the mud to refer to the object as Excalibur.
    Please note that you still have to have set_id() and
    set_adjectives() so the mud knows what the player can refer
    to the object as.  For example:


include <mudlib.h>

inherit OBJ;

setup()
{
     set_id( "sword", "Excalibur"  );
     set_adj(  "King Arthur's"  );
     set_long( "This is a hideously sharp blade" );

}

set_unique(1);  

     This will force the mud to refer to an object as 'the .....'.
     Usually reserved for items that are unique.  i.e. unique items 
     should probably be refered to as 'the' instead of 'a'.

set_in_room_desc("A dumb terminal sits in the corner of the room.\n");

     This will replace the default message of 'a dumb terminal sits 
     here, discarded' with the above message.  This works well.  
     However, for objects that can be taken, everytime you drop them
     they will go to the corner of the room.  This would be rather odd
     in a round room.  the solution is to use set_untouched_desc.

set_untouched_desc()

     This can be used to give a very verbose description of where the
     item is in the room.  However once the item is moved this
     description is no longer used.

========================================================================


Your base object is still useless as it cant be picked up or
used in any way.  In order to change the functionality of your
object you need to inherit files of the form M_*.  this will add 
the necessary functions to allow you to change the way you object
behaves.

The following M_* files are available:

   M_GETTABLE    Functions for object that can be picked up
   M_LOCKABLE    Functions for objects that can be locked/unlocked
   M_ANSI        Functions for using %^ ansi protocol
   M_WEARABLE    Functions for things that can be worn
   M_ITEMS       Functions for providing virtual/fake items for
                 objects
   M_OPENABLE    Functions for objects that can be opened and closed 
   M_READABLE    Functions for something that can be read
   M_WIELDABLE   Functions for something that can be wielded (weapons)
   
There are a few more inheritables that may be used also but dont fit 
into the module category.

   CONTAINER     Makes your object a container for other objects.
   ENTERABLE     Makes your object able to be entered.                   
   WEAPON        Weapons
   MONSTERS      Monsters
   DOOR          Doors to places
   LIVING        Can hold things and perform actions(no fighting)
          
For the documentation on these inheritables please see the 
appropriate help file for that inheritable.  Also note that 
work is in progress on these so they may not be entirely complete.
