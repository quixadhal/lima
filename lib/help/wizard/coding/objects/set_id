Setting the Id


Your object needs to be identified by an id/ids.
This allows the player to interact with
your object using those id/ids.  In order to 
tell the mud what your objects id/ids are put the 
following function in your objects create().

      set_id("terminal","computer","monitor")
   
The player can now refer to your object using any
of the above ids.
 

Tips:

   Try to use any id that a player may use.
   Don't use caps.
