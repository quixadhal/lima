At this point, it is probably easiest to get the general feel of
what wizard topics are available by browsing the /help/wizard
directories.  Here are a few to start with, though:

  coding: headers, rooms(*), style, quests

  std: security, input_handling, book, container, door,
	 enterable, gettable

  moduless: getopt, grammar, lpc, messages(*), objcalls(*), parsing,
	path(*), regex, string(*)

  misc: exits(*), simul_efuns, global_macros
 
  cmds: showemote, goto, objdump, quest, timer, 
        objcount, objfind, users, didlog, exits, I
     echo, echoto, echoall, clean
          clone, dest

(*) highly recommended

Don't forget to read all the player topics, too.
