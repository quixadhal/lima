USAGE:  mv  source destination

   This command will allow you to move files from source to 
destination.  The source file must exist, the destination may or 
may not exist at the time of the move.  If the destination does 
not exist one will be created, if the destination does exist, at 
the time of the move it will be overwritten.  the source file will
be removed.

If you do not supply a full path name mv will assume that the 
files will be in your current directory.

I will now have workroom.c in the current directory and wizroom.c 
  will no longer exist.

cp /domains/std/wizroom.c /wiz/zifnab/workroom.c
