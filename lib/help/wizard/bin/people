syntax: people [flags]

Instead of calling the cmd with flags you can do:
'set people_flags [flags]' the flags that you appoint will be automatically
 used as your default arguments when the command is called.

ex: 
'set people_flags hpnI'
or
'people hpnI'

The available flags are as follows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
W -This flag will show wizards only. It will not print anything, it just
   filters the users and removes anyone without wizard status.
P -This flag shows players only. Another filter, this command just removes
   any wizards from the who list.
A -This flag shows demigods or Gods, filter only.
D -This flag adds an informative line of info triggered by other flags, fex.
   if your command supports the 'W' flag the info line would print:
   'Wizards only'
