The goto command is a simple meathod
of teleportation which can move you either
to a specific room or to whatever room 
a certain player is in.

	goto <player>
	goto <room>

If the room is in your current directory,
the filename indicates the destination.

	goto workroom.c

If the room is not in your current directory,
directory/filename format should be used.

	goto /wiz/azy/workroom.c
