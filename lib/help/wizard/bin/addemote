 
USAGE:  addemote (verb)

  This command allows you to add new souls.  (verb) being the soul.

After entering the addemote soul you will be asked for the rule.
The rule consists of one of the following; OBJ, LIV, STR etc.
Then you will be asked for the message.

addemote kick
rule STR
message: $N $vkick $T

To add a new rule treat it as if the whole emote was new, just
follow the same steps as for adding a brand new emote.

The message can also be multiple messages separated by " && "; these
as the message for the doer, others, the first target, the second target ...
respectively.

e.g. $N $vkick $t hard. && $N $vkick $t hard (how mean).

gives:
me: You kick Rust hard.
rust: Beek kicks you hard.
room: Beek kicks Rust hard (how mean).

(when there is no message for the target, they see the first one)

also: $N $vkick $t hard. && $N $vkick $t hard (how mean). && $N $vkick $t hard (ouch!).

gives:
me: You kick Rust hard.
rust: Beek kicks you hard (ouch!).
room: Beek kicks Rust hard (how mean).
