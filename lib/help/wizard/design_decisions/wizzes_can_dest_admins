Wizzes are quite capable of desting admins.  And we allow it.  In
fact, there are MANY things that are allowed by the mudlib that
might otherwise be viewed as bothersome, annoying, or just plain
downright problematic.

Our general view is this: if a wiz is intent on being a pest, then
there is no amount of coding and protection that you can put into
a mudlib to prevent that situation.  Nothing.

Given that, we simply opted not to bulk up the lib with a zillion
checks and protections and safeguards when their only end result is
to stump some dumb wizards, but slow down the whole lib to the
detriment of who you're really there for: the players.

So what's the answer to these bothersome wizards?  Heh. Grow up
and ban them.  Quite simple.  First time they're a pest, just tell
them "Don't do that."  Second time, ban them.  Our view is that
people can be adults and work together.
