M_DIGGABLE


M_DIGGABLE is an inherit that lets players "dig" in your object.
This module requires the use of M_INPUT as well, so make sure
you inherit that also.  

Important functions:

     complete_dig() --  Is called by do_dig_with_object() in 
                        /cmds/verbs/dig.c.  This functoin checks
                        to see if you are carrying an object that 
                        you can dig with.  If so it calls do_digging(),
                        passing it the object you are digging in,
                        if not it returns an error message.

     answer_question() --  Modal thingy allowing you to answer the 
                        question dig with what?


     is_diggable()  --  Returns 1 if the object can be dug in.


Other functions:

     direct_dig_in_obj()
     direct_dig_out_obj()
     direct_dig_up_obj()
     direct_dig_obj_with_obj()
     can_dig_in_obj()
     can_dig_up_obj()
     can_dog_out_obj()
     direct_dig_in_obj_with_obj()
     direct_dig_out_obj_with_obj()
     direct_dig_obj_up_with_obj()
     direct_dig_with_obj_in_obj()

           All of the above are parser "callbacks".  In this module
           they all return 1, which means that those things can happen.
           If you wish you may overload any of thses functions to stop
           that action from happening.
