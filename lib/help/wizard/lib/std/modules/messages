MESSAGE MODULE:

*** Introduction:

The message module exists to simplify and standardize messages on ZorkMUD.
It is designed to replace code like the following:

write("You bing at "+target->query_name()+".\n");
tell_object(target, this_player()->query_name()+" bings at you.\n");
tell_room(environment(this_player()), this_player()->query_name()+" bings at "+target->query_name()+".\n");

Compare that to the following:

this_player()->targetted_action("$N $vbing at $t.\n", target);

The message module will create the appropriate messages and send them
to the correct places.  targetted_action can be called in any object
which has inherited the MESSAGES module, which is inherited in
LIVING, WEAPON, ZORKER, DEV already.


**** The Simple Interface:

Four routines make up the simple version of the message interface:

simple_action(message [, object [,object] ] )
   for simple actions only involving the doer and optionally some
   objects (or strings, see below)

other_action(message, [, object [, object] ] )
   same as simple_action, but only sends messages to the room

my_action(message, ...)
   only send messages to the doer

targetted_action(message, target [, object [, object] ] )
   for simple actions involving the doer, a target, and possibly
   some objects or strings

The appropriate routine should be called in the object that is
actually _doing_ the action.

If the message is actually an array of messages, one of the messages
will be chosen at random.

**** Format for Messages:

A quick note: If you want something capitalized, use the upper
case version ($N) as opposed to $n.

Here are the variables that can be used in messages:
(Tell Beek if you have other things you would like to see here)

$N - A name.  Defaults to the name of the doer.
       if given a number, corresponds to that index into the who
       list (only usable with more complex messages, see below)
       starting with zero.  For example, $N3 is the name of the
       4th person in the who list.  The following flags can be added:
	p - disable pronouns ('proper name')
	s - subjective
	o - objective
       so $n1p is the proper name of the second person in the who list	

$T - The name of the target.
       $T is actually the same as $N1o. i.e. the first person after
       the doer in the who list.
       Notice that it's objective by default; if you want to use
       the target as the subject, use $N1 or $Ts.
       $T allows the same flags as $N; in fact it is identical to $N
       except for that it uses objective by default, and defaults to
       person #1, not #0.  Two args can also be given, in that case
       the first is taken as the subject of the sentence (needed for
       proper handling of reflexification when someone is both the doer
       and the target in a complex sentence).  The subject defaults to
       $n0, which is usually right.  Any example of a case when it isn't:
     
	$n1 $v1kick $t11 and not $n1 $v1kick $t.

       The second gives "Beek kicks him" instead of "himself" when $n0 is
       someone else.

$V - A verb
       The message module must know what is a verb so it can conjugate
       them correctly.  Verbs are always given in the 2nd person
       ("you ...") form, so when writing messages it is best to think
       from the perspective of the message that will go to the doer.
       For example, "$N $vlook at ..." is correct, but "$N $vlooks .."
       is not.  It will create odd messages like "Beek lookses at "
       and "You looks at".  An optional number can be inserted
       before the verb, indicating who is the subject (defaults to
       zero; the doer is the subject of the sentence).  This is
       usefull for more complex messages:
           "$N $vpuke on $t.  $N1 $v1are covered with slime!"
       A couple things to note: $V1 is the correct way
       to make $N1 the subject of the sentence.  Also, "is" is given
       in the 2nd person form ("are").  This means you have to
       switch your perspective when switching subjects. The first
       half of the sentence is written from the perspective of the
       puker; the second half from the perspective of the pukee.

$P - a possessive
       Takes an (optional) number to indicate who.  It will generate
       either a named possessive ("Beek's") or a pronoun ("his")
       depending on the context.

$R - Reflexive:  I.e. 'yourself', 'himself', 'itself'.  Take a number
       to indicate which person it refers to.

$O - Takes an (optional) number to indicate which of the two optional
       objects it refers to.  If the object passed is an object, it's
       short() is used.  If it is a string, the string is used.
       Note that the module is smart about articles; if you include
       one with an object that doesn't need an article, it is omitted.

**** Advanced Messaging:

The above routines work fine assuming you want messages to go to the
standard places.  What if they should go across a channel?  Be sent
to another routine? etc etc etc
Then you must use the actual routine that all the above are based
on:

string* action( string* wholist, message [, mixed ob [, mixed ob2 ]] )

The wholist is a list of people participating in the action, i.e.
({ this_player(), target }), and corresponds to $N0, $N1, etc ...
The message and objects are the same as above.

The routine returns an array of strings; one string containing a
message for each person in the who list, and an extra one for anyone
who isn't directly involved (the simple routines send that message
to the room).

These messages can then be sent wherever you want, etc.  A routine
exists to send them, if you're doing something that is *almost*
simple (maybe the messages have to be seen in more than one room,
etc).

inform(wholist, msgs, other)

where wholist is the wholist from above, msgs was returned by action()
and other is the object to send the extra message to via tell_room().
